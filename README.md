# OBS Stabilizer Plugin

Real-time video stabilization plugin for OBS Studio using OpenCV computer vision algorithms.

## Overview

OBS Stabilizer provides real-time video stabilization for livestreams and recordings in OBS Studio. This plugin implements Point Feature Matching algorithms to reduce camera shake and improve video quality without significant performance impact.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Planned targets for 30+ fps performance on HD video
- **Low Latency**: Target <4ms processing time per frame on modern hardware  
- **Adaptive Algorithms**: Intelligent feature detection with fallback strategies
- **User-Friendly UI**: Integrated OBS properties panel with presets
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, and Linux support

## Technical Specifications

- **Core Algorithm**: Point Feature Matching with Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow
- **Dependencies**: OpenCV 4.5+, Qt6, OBS Studio 30.0+
- **Language**: C++17/20
- **Build System**: CMake 3.28+
- **License**: GPL-2.0 (OBS Studio compatible)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- OBS Studio 30.0 or higher
- OpenCV 4.5+ development libraries
- CMake 3.28+ 
- Qt6 development libraries
- C++17 compatible compiler

### Building from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/azumag/obs-stabilizer.git
cd obs-stabilizer

# Configure build
cmake --preset <platform>-ci
# Available presets: macos-ci, windows-ci-x64, ubuntu-ci-x86_64

# Build the plugin
cmake --build --preset <platform>-ci
```

### Installation

1. Copy the built plugin to your OBS plugins directory
2. Restart OBS Studio
3. Add "Video Stabilizer" filter to your video source
4. Configure stabilization parameters as needed

## Configuration Options

- **Enable Stabilization**: Toggle stabilization on/off
- **Smoothing Radius**: Frame averaging window (10-100 frames)
- **Feature Points**: Number of tracking points (100-1000)
- **Crop Mode**: Handle borders with cropping or padding

## Performance Targets (Planned)

| Resolution | Target Processing Time | Estimated CPU Usage |
|------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 720p       | <2ms/frame          | <15%             |
| 1080p      | <4ms/frame          | <20%             |
| 4K         | <10ms/frame         | <35%             |

*Performance targets are preliminary and subject to validation through development.*
