# Implementation Report

## Summary
Fixed a critical build failure reported by the review agent.

## Changes
- **File Modified:** `src/stabilizer_opencv.cpp`
- **Issue:** The build was failing due to a duplicated and malformed implementation of the `stabilizer_filter_update` function. This included a typo (`settings_to_param` instead of `settings_to_params`) and conflicting logic.
- **Resolution:**
  - Removed the duplicated code block.
  - Corrected the typo and unified the function logic to correctly handle parameter updates.
  - This fix resolves the underlying cause of the compile error related to `const` qualifiers that was flagged in the QA report.
