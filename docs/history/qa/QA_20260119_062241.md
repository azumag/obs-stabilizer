# QA Report

**Date:** 2026-01-19

## Summary

The project fails to build due to a missing `obs-frontend-api.h` file. The `CMakeLists.txt` file is overly complex and contains errors that prevent the project from being configured and built.

## Issues

- **Missing `obs-frontend-api.h`:** The build process requires the `obs-frontend-api.h` file, which is not present in the repository. This causes the CMake configuration to fail.
- **`CMakeLists.txt` errors:** The `CMakeLists.txt` file has several issues, including incorrect conditional logic and misplaced commands, which prevent the project from being configured correctly.

## Recommendations

- **Provide the missing `obs-frontend-api.h` file:** The `obs-frontend-api.h` file should be added to the repository.
- **Simplify and fix `CMakeLists.txt`:** The `CMakeLists.txt` file should be refactored to be simpler and more robust. The conditional logic for handling the standalone test build needs to be corrected.
