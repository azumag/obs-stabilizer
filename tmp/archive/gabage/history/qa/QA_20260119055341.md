# QA Report

## Summary

The build failed due to compiler errors. This indicates a regression and a failure to meet the quality standards outlined in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Issues Found

### 1. Build Failure: `const` correctness errors

- **File:** `src/stabilizer_opencv.cpp`
- **Lines:** 304-313
- **Description:** The compiler threw errors because a `const obs_data_t *` was passed to `obs_data_get_*` functions that expect a non-const `obs_data_t *`. This violates C++ `const` correctness principles.
- **Impact:** The plugin cannot be built, making it completely non-functional.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Fails "all tests are passing" and "implementation meets design specifications".

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a `build` directory.
2. Run `cmake ..` from the `build` directory.
3. Run `make` from the `build` directory.
4. The build will fail with compiler errors.

## Feedback for Implementation Agent

The build is broken due to `const` correctness issues in `src/stabilizer_opencv.cpp`. Please fix the compiler errors and ensure that the build is successful before submitting for QA again.
