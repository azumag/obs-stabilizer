add_custom_command(TARGET ${TARGET} POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL} -id "${OUTPUT_NAME}" 
        "$<TARGET_FILE:${TARGET}>"
    COMMENT "Setting correct install name for macOS plugin"
)

# ENHANCED: Proper OBS framework path resolution
add_custom_command(TARGET ${TARGET} POST_BUILD
    COMMAND ${CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_TOOL} -add_rpath "@loader_path/../../../../Frameworks" "$<TARGET_FILE:${TARGET}>" || true
    COMMENT "Adding rpath for OBS framework"
)
```

#### Verification Results:
```bash
otool -L libobs-stabilizer.0.1.0.dylib
# ✅ No circular @loader_path references
# ✅ Proper OpenCV library paths configured
# ✅ System libraries correctly resolved
```

### 4. Plugin Loading Mechanism ✅ VERIFIED
**Status: OPERATIONAL**
